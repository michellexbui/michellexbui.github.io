Here is a link to my full [CV](/files/latex_cv_research.pdf).

Education
======
* Ph.D. in Space Sciences, University of Michigan, 2025-
* M.S. in Atmospheric Sciences, Cornell University, 2021-2024
* Honors B.S. in Physics, Minor in Mathematics, University of Texas at Arlington, 2017-2021

Research experience
======
* Fall 2021-Fall 2024: Graduate Research Assistant with Dr. David Hysell at Cornell University
  * Simulating coupled ion-neutral dynamics in the lower E-Region of the ionosphere and lower thermosphere
  * Analyzed coherent scatter radar data to observe structuring of sporadic-E ionization layers.
* Spring 2018-Spring 2021: Undergraduate Researcher at University of Texas at Arlington
  * With Dr. Ramon Lopez:
    * Studied the relationship between solar wind, magnetopause current, and magnetopause motion using theoretical and statistical, computational analyses.
    * Investigated effects of high speed solar wind stream events on bursty bulk flow events in the magnetotail using analysis techniques on NASA satellite data.
  * With Dr. Daniel Welling: 
    * Studied the connection between magnetotail tilt and inter-hemispheric asymmetries in ionospheric outflow through computational model and data analyses.
    * Triangulated ground-based magnetometer data from SuperMAG to determine fluctuations in magnetic field and applied these results to interdisciplinary research regarding fluctuations in bird migratory patterns.
