I believe that a teacher and mentor should be effective, intentional, and patient in order to build strong, independent learners. I have taught and mentored a variety of students with various goals and needs, including many nontraditional and first-generation college students. I deeply believe that education and academia is a place for everyone.

I currently work as an Adjunct Instructor and Professional Tutor at [Tompkins-Cortland Community College](https://www.tompkinscortland.edu/library/tutoring-schedule) (Dryden, NY). I teach an accelerated Introduction to Databases course for students pursuing associates degrees in Computer Science, Information Science, Information Technology, Accounting, and similar majors. At the Math & Science Tutoring Center, I specialize in Physics I-II, Calculus I-III, Pre-Calculus, College Algebra, Introduction to Computer Science, and Technology courses. 

Previously, I worked as an Academic Instructor and Tutor at [Porter Tutoring](https://www.portertutoring.com) (Arlington, TX). I developed curriculum and instruction for SAT/ACT preparation courses as well as homeschool math and sciences for nontraditional middle to high school students. In addition to teaching, I also tutored college and K-12 students in math and sciences.
