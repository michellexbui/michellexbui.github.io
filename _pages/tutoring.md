I have over seven years of experience in tutoring, instruction, and test preparation for a variety of science and math topics at the college/university level, high school level, and middle school level. Based on your work, I also prepare exam review materials free of charge. I enjoy providing extra review materials for students!

# Test Preparation

At Porter Tutoring (Dallas-Fort Worth, TX) I developed curriculum and instructed for their PSAT, SAT, and ACT preparation program. I watched my students exceed their program requirements and achieve scholarship-level scores!

My rate for test preparation is **$60 per one-hour session.** 
Any take-home materials, such as homeworks and tests, is **free of charge!** I'm always happy to provide practice materials.
