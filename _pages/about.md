Hi! I am a Deans Scholar and second-year graduate student at Cornell University, studying small-scale ionospheric irregularities under Dr. David L. Hysell. In particular, I am analyzing how convective instabilities in the lower thermosphere dynamically drive sporadic-E irregularities. With Dr. Hysell's advice, I am working to simulate coupled ion-neutral dynamics, particularly that of neutral Ekman-type instabilities.

Previously, I completed an Honors B.S. in Physics with minor in Mathematics through University of Texas at Arlington. Alongside my undergraduate studies, I worked as an undergraduate researcher in space physics for two research groups. In Dr. Ramon Lopez's research group, I spent four years briefly studying bursty bulk flows in the nightside magnetosphere and primarily studying dayside magnetopause interactions. I analyzed THEMIS satellite data using Python In Dr. Daniel Welling's research group, I spent almost two years analyzing magnetometer data for a collaboration with Dr. Ben Winger's ornithology research group at University of Michigan, where they studied a correlation between deviations in bird migration with space weather phenomena.

Education is another passion of mine. I worked as an academic tutor at Porter Tutoring (Arlington, TX) for college-level courses such as Physics I-II and calculus courses as well as high school physics and math. I also developed and taught curriculum for SAT/ACT preparation and homeschool sciences for middle and high school levels. 

Aside from academics, I spend my time enjoying music and amateurly playing a handful of instruments. Painting and embroidering are my favorite ways to relax. I also consume a fair amount of movies and shows, and my current favorites are Phantom Thread (2017) and Succession (2018-2023).
