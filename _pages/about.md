Hi friend! I recently finished my MS in Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University, where I worked with an [aeronomy research group](http://landau.geo.cornell.edu) studying small-scale ionospheric irregularities in the E region ionosphere. In particular, my research focused on connecting thermospheric wind shears to sporadic-E layer structuring, as seen in [coherent scatter radar data](http://landau.geo.cornell.edu/zeman.html) and fluid simulations ([Hysell et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1029/2024JA033088); [Bui et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022JA030929).

Previously, I completed an Honors B.S. in Physics with minor in Mathematics at University of Texas at Arlington. Alongside my undergraduate degree, I worked for two space plasma physics research groups. In Dr. Ramon Lopez's research group, I studied dayside magnetopause interactions and magnetotail bursty bulk flows using [satellite data](https://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov) and analyzed these physical processes through statistical and physical interpretations. As a McNair Scholar, I completed my Honors thesis on characterizing the relationship between the dayside magnetopause current sheet and the solar wind ([Bui and Lopez, 2021](http://hdl.handle.net/10106/29689))

In Dr. Daniel Welling's research group, I investigated ground-level space weather impacts using [magnetometer data](https://supermag.jhuapl.edu) for a collaboration with Dr. Ben Winger's ornithology research group at University of Michigan, where they studied a correlation between deviations in bird migration with space weather phenomena ([Gulson-Castillo et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2306317120)). Through the [CUSIA group](https://cusia.uta.edu), I also studied the connection between magnetotail tilt and interhemispheric asymmetries in ionospheric outflow ([Bui et al, 2020](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm20/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/737735))

Education is another passion of mine. I work as a Professional Tutor with [Tompkins-Cortland Community College](https://www.tompkinscortland.edu/library/tutoring-schedule) (Dryden, NY), where I specialize in Physics I-II, Calculus I-III, Pre-Calculus, College Algebra, and Intro to Computer Sciences. Prior to this, I worked as an Academic Instructor and Tutor at [Porter Tutoring](https://www.portertutoring.com) (Arlington, TX), where I developed curriculum and instructed SAT and ACT preparation courses as well as homeschool math and sciences for middle to high schoolers. I also tutored college level, high school level, and middle school level math and sciences. I also have a longstanding history of Private Academic Tutoring, and I deeply care about mentoring students to becoming strong, independent learners.

Aside from academics, I spend my time enjoying music and amateurly playing a handful of instruments. Painting, embroidering, and cooking are some of my favorite ways to relax. Recent additions to my favorite movies and shows include Anatomy of a Murder (1959) and Succession (2018-2023).
