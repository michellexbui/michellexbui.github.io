Hi!! I recently finished my MS in Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University, where I worked with an [aeronomy research group](http://landau.geo.cornell.edu) studying small-scale ionospheric irregularities in the E region ionosphere. In particular, my research focused on connecting thermospheric wind shears to sporadic-E layer structuring, as seen in [coherent scatter radar data](http://landau.geo.cornell.edu/zeman.html) and fluid simulations ([Hysell et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1029/2024JA033088); [Bui et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022JA030929).

Previously, I completed an Honors B.S. in Physics with minor in Mathematics at University of Texas at Arlington. Alongside my undergraduate degree, I worked for two space plasma physics research groups. In Dr. Ramon Lopez's research group, I studied dayside magnetopause interactions and magnetotail bursty bulk flows using [satellite data](https://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov) and analyzed these physical processes through statistical and physical interpretations. 

In Dr. Daniel Welling's research group, I investigated ground-level space weather impacts using [magnetometer data](https://supermag.jhuapl.edu) for a collaboration with Dr. Ben Winger's ornithology research group at University of Michigan, where they studied a correlation between deviations in bird migration with space weather phenomena ([Gulson-Castillo et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2306317120)). I also studied the connection between magnetotail tilt and interhemispheric asymmetries in ionospheric outflow 

Education is another passion of mine. I worked as an academic tutor at Porter Tutoring (Arlington, TX) for college-level courses such as Physics I-II and calculus courses as well as high school physics and math. I also developed and taught curriculum for SAT/ACT preparation and homeschool sciences for middle and high school levels. 

Aside from academics, I spend my time enjoying music and amateurly playing a handful of instruments. Painting and embroidering are my favorite ways to relax. I also consume a fair amount of movies and shows, and my current favorites are Phantom Thread (2017) and Succession (2018-2023).
