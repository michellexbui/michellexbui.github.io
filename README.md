# Things to keep updated:
* "Publications" and "CV" page
* "Tutoring" page with HTML embedded form to sign up for a tutoring session

## To-Do's:
* Once I start uploading practice materials and video lectures, I will publicize a "Teaching" tab which will be organized by topic, subtopics, and corresponding study materials (PDFs, video lectures, etc).
* I should update my blog posts!! I'm terrible at diary entries lol and need to push myself to write more.
* Change my profile pic so it's not just a car selfie lolol
