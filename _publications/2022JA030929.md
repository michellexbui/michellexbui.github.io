title: "Midlatitude Sporadic E-Layer Horizontal Structuring Modulated by Neutral Instability and Mixing in the Lower Thermosphere"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022JA030929
excerpt: 'We consider whether neutral instability and turbulence in the lower thermosphere is the likely cause for some of the structuring in the sporadic- E layers. Results of 3D numerical simulations of atmospheric dynamics in the mesosphere to lower thermosphere support the proposition. Future work involves coupling ion-neutral dynamics to further support sporadic-E layer structuring caused by convective instabilities in the neutral atmosphere.'
